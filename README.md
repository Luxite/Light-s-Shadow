Light's Shadow
==============

The only light is the one at the end of the tunnel.

This is the Light's Shadow modpack. In this Minecraft modpack we hope to achieve a balance of magic, technology, and 
adventure with a touch of hardcore. And by touch I mean a full body slam that will leave you crying. The darkness is 
the major problem in this modpack but you'll enjoy all the best mods like Thaumcraft 4 and Buildcraft in this modpack. 
Enjoy.


Sincerely 
Doggychow and Luxite
